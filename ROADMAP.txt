Housing is a local good

Rural housing
    For working pops
        Produced by subsistance farms or agricultural buildings
        Used by pops employed by these buildings
        Uses a production method that determines housing development pattern (on land vs rural towns)
    For owning pops
        Produced by manor houses

Urban housing
    For working class pops # added worker_housing
        Produced by worker housing buildings
    For middle and upper class pops # added bourgeois_housing
        Produced by bourgeois housing buildings

Housing buildings don't consume anything

Housing building size is limited by the amount of different urban transportation services produced in a state (horizontality)

Housing building throughput is limited by technology concerning verticality

# I need to figure out how to get different pop_types to demand different housing types
# I should probably make housing need in a state depend on urbanisation (1 to 1 with urban centres)
# Likewise, I should probably make transportation centres be 1 to 1 with urban centres
# Housing as a good will not work since there's no way to separate pop_type good demand

in save file, urban centre sizes are from line 4636624 to 4721445

The event scopes are a pain in the ass because there is no documentation online.

I'll need to redo output values to rebalance service and transportation outputs back to vanilla
Instead, production methods should have more to do with modifiers affecting growth, unrest, and loyalty
