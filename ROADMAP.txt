Housing is a local good

Rural housing
    For working pops
        Produced by subsistance farms or agricultural buildings
        Used by pops employed by these buildings
        Uses a production method that determines housing development pattern (on land vs rural towns)
    For owning pops
        Produced by manor houses

Urban housing
    For working class pops # added worker_housing
        Produced by worker housing buildings
    For middle and upper class pops # added bourgeois_housing
        Produced by bourgeois housing buildings

Housing buildings don't consume anything

Housing building size is limited by the amount of different urban transportation services produced in a state (horizontality)

Housing building throughput is limited by technology concerning verticality

# I need to figure out how to get different pop_types to demand different housing types
# I should probably make housing need in a state depend on urbanisation (1 to 1 with urban centres)
# Likewise, I should probably make transportation centres be 1 to 1 with urban centres
# Housing as a good will not work since there's no way to separate pop_type good demand

I want different buildings for each size of city, so burg (max 50), faubourg (max 150), rail suburb (no limit)
